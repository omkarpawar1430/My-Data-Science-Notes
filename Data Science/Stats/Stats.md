Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It provides methods and tools for summarizing and describing data, making inferences and predictions based on data, and testing hypotheses and theories using statistical models.

# [[Data]]:

Data refers to any collection of facts, observations, or measurements that are gathered through experiments, surveys, or other methods of data collection.

# Types of Statistics

## [[Descriptive Stats]]:

Descriptive statistics refers to the methods used to summarize, organize, and describe the characteristics of a dataset. These methods can be used to describe the central tendency, variability, and shape of the data. Descriptive statistics include measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and percentiles.


## [[Inferential Stats]]:


Inferential statistics involves using statistical methods to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. These methods are used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and estimate population parameters based on sample statistics. Inferential statistics includes techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and ANOVA.

- example
    
    A real-world example of the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics is as follows:
    
    Suppose a company wants to analyze the salaries of its employees to determine the average salary of all its employees.
    
    Descriptive statistics would be used to summarize and describe the data that has been collected, such as finding the mean, median, and mode of the salaries of all employees in the company. This information would give the company an overview of the salaries of its employees and provide a general idea of the range and distribution of salaries within the company.
    
    On the other hand, inferential statistics would be used if the company wanted to make predictions or draw conclusions about the larger population of employees based on a smaller sample of data. For example, if the company wanted to determine if male and female employees have significantly different salaries, inferential statistics could be used to test a hypothesis and make a conclusion based on the sample data collected.
    
    In this case, descriptive statistics would provide an overview of the salary data, while inferential statistics would be used to make predictions or draw conclusions about the larger population based on a smaller sample of data.

The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure used to assess the relative variability of a set of data. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of a dataset to its mean, expressed as a percentage.

Mathematically, the coefficient of variation can be expressed as:

CV = (standard deviation / mean) x 100%

The coefficient of variation is useful when comparing datasets with different units or scales, as it provides a standardized measure of relative variability. It is commonly used in fields such as finance, economics, and engineering to compare the variability of different stocks, economic indicators, or physical measurements.

A low coefficient of variation indicates that the data points are closely clustered around the mean, while a high coefficient of variation indicates that the data points are more spread out. Generally, a CV of less than 15% is considered low, while a CV greater than 30% is considered high.

In summary, the coefficient of variation is a useful statistical tool for assessing the relative variability of a set of data, particularly when comparing datasets with different units or scales.

- A probability density function describes a probability distribution for a  continuous random variable.
- Use a probability density function **to find the chances that the value of a random variable will occur within a range of values that you specify**.
- Probability density functions can find non-zero likelihoods for a continuous random variable X falling within the interval [a, b].
- The total area under the curve equals one on a probability density plot, representing the total probability of 1 for the full range of possible values in the distribution.
- Finding the chances for a smaller range of interest involves finding the portion of the area under the curve corresponding to that range.

Consider that the probability for a PDF in statistics equals an area. For a non-zero area, you must have both a non-zero height and a non-zero width because Height X Width = Area. In this context, the height is the curve’s height on the graph, while the width relates to the range of values. When you have a single value, you have zero width, which produces zero areas. Hence, a zero chance!

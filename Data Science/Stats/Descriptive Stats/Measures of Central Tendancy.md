measures of central tendency are used to describe the central or typical value of a set of data. There are three common measures of central tendency. It is crucial to understand that the central tendency summarizes only one aspect of a distribution and that it provides an incomplete picture by itself.

### Mean

Mean: The mean is the sum of all the values in a set of data divided by the total number of values. It is also known as the average value. The formula for calculating the mean is:

Mean = (sum of all values) / (total number of values)

For example, if we have the following set of data: 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, the mean would be:

Mean = (5+7+10+12+15) / 5 = 9.8

- When to Use:
    - Use the mean when there are no extreme values or outliers in the data.
    - Use the mean when the data is normally distributed (i.e., the data follows a bell-shaped curve).

### Median

Median: The median is the middle value in a set of data when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest). If there are an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

For example, if we have the following set of data: 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, the median would be 10.

And For 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16 the median would be  $(10 + 12 ) / 2 = 11$

- When to Use:
    - Use the median when the data is skewed (i.e., the data is not evenly distributed around the center).
    - Use the median when there are extreme values or outliers in the data.

### Mode

Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a set of data. If no value appears more than once, then the set of data has no mode. Typically, you use the mode with categorical, ordinal, and discrete data. In fact, the mode is the only measure of central tendency that you can use with [categorical data](https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/categorical-variables/) such as the most preferred flavor of ice cream. However, with categorical data, there isn’t a central value because you can’t order the groups. With ordinal and discrete data, the mode can be a value that is not in the center. Again, the mode represents the most common value.

For example, if we have the following set of data: 5, 7, 10, 10, 12, 15, the mode would be 10.

- When to use:
    - Use the mode when you want to identify the most common value or values in a set of data.
    - Use the mode when the data is categorical or when the values are grouped into intervals.

    In Summary, When you have a symmetrical distribution for continuous data, the mean, median, and mode are equal. In this case, analysts tend to use the mean because it includes all of the data in the calculations. However, if you have a skewed distribution, the median is often the best measure of central tendency.
    
    When you have ordinal data, the median or mode is usually the best choice. For categorical data, you must use the mode.

The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance. Recall that the variance is in squared units. Hence, the square root returns the value to the natural units. The symbol for the standard deviation as a population parameter is σ while s represents it as a sample estimate.

Standard deviation is widely used in statistics and data analysis because it is more easily interpretable than variance, as it is expressed in the same units as the data. Standard deviation can help to identify outliers or extreme values in a dataset, and can also be used to detect and analyze differences in variability between different groups or subgroups in a dataset.

When to use standard deviation or variance depends on the specific situation. If the goal is to calculate other statistical measures, such as the coefficient of variation, it may be necessary to calculate the variance first. However, if the goal is to communicate the variability of the data in a more easily interpretable way, the standard deviation is usually more appropriate.

While variance and standard deviation are both measures of the spread or dispersion of a dataset, they have different properties. Variance is more sensitive to outliers or extreme values in the dataset, and it is expressed in squared units. Standard deviation, on the other hand, is less sensitive to outliers and is expressed in the same units as the data. As a result, standard deviation is often preferred in situations where a more intuitive and easily interpretable measure of variability is needed.
